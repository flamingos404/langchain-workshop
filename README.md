# Online Workshop on Longchain & Open-source LLMs

## Workshop Description

Hey everyone,

I've got an idea for an engaging online workshop! We'll be diving into Langchain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models, and exploring its potential with the latest open-source Language Models (LLMs).
see https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction

**Here's the plan:**
The workshop will give participants hands-on experience with Longchain - how it works, storing data, and making the most out of it. Plus, we'll blend in the power of open-source LLMs to see how they can supercharge Longchain for some really awesome applications.

### Objectives

- Langchain basics.
- Show how LLMs can level up Longchain's capabilities.
- Encourage participants to brainstorm and build cool stuff using Langchain and LLMs.

### What's in it?

- Sessions will cover Langchain and LLM integration.
- Many interactive activities and group discussions.
- Resources and support materials to help participants create their own projects.

### Why it matters?

We're aiming to create a community of folks excited about Langchain and recent LLMs (such as Llama and Mixtral).
This workshop could spark some fantastic ideas and collaborations in this space!

In a nutshell, this workshop could be a game-changer in how we use Longchain and LLMs.
I'm thrilled about the potential and would love your thoughts on making this happen.
